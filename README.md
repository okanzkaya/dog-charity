# responsive-dog-charity-website

I have used mobile-first approach in this project.

This website is compatible with phone screens, tablet screens and desktop or laptop screens.(responsive & cross-browser)

I have not used any external libraries. (Plain HTML, CSS, JS Only.)

I just wanted to create a charity website with cute puppy pictures, I hope you liked it.

You can use, share, deploy.
